# AutoEncoders
AutoEncoders Keras
Used for
dimensionality reduction and noise removal
Difference between ANN and Autoencoder is latter has the same number of output layers as input layers
The hidden layer reduces the dimonsionality to take the most important features (23 features, cant be presented in space)
3 features can be presented in 3d
Encoder and Decoder 
We grab the encoder - which reduces dimensionality; when it comes to decoder,
it does check whether the encoder reduces dimensioanlity correctly by making sure that model retains main features
